            <p> Caring for zoo animals requires the ability to deal with an awful lot of poo … or dung, excrement,
              animal waste, or faeces (the latter being used if you want to be more technical). Shovelling the
              proverbial is often how we start and end our day in the zoo. But aside from ensuring that we provide
              animals with clean environments, this process of collecting animal poo is also a vital part of their
              healthcare.

          <p> ou may not know it, but cows share information every time they burp, moo, and chew that speaks volumes
            about their health and welfare.

            Through the work of researchers in Virginia Techs College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, we may soon know
            more about what cows are “telling” us and be able to use that information to improve their well-being.

          <p>Our team will raise goats for milk, to utilize their manure as fertilizer, and to engage them in rangeland
            management for controlling noxious weeds. Their milk has health benefits and can be used to make butter,
            cheese, and yoghurt. They will consume/recycle almost any food items and produce manure for use as a
            fertilizer, and they have a natural ability to improve rangeland</p>

          <p>Chickens breed in the spring and summer months. Egg laying is stimulated by the long stretches of daylight
            that occur during the warmer months; however, artificial lights placed in chicken coops can trigger a hens
            egg laying response throughout the year. The time between ovulation and egg-laying is approximately 2326
            hours. Subsequent ovulations may occur within an hour after the previous egg was laid, allowing some hens to
            produce as many as 300 eggs per year.
